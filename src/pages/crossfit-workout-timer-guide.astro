        A CrossFit workout lives and dies by its timer. The clock determines
        when work starts, when rest ends, how many rounds you complete, and
        whether your score is valid. Understanding the five major WOD formats —
        and knowing how to set up the right timer for each — is foundational to
        CrossFit training, whether you are an athlete or a coach.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This guide covers every main CrossFit WOD format: what it means, how
        scoring works, common variations, and step-by-step timer setup for each
        format using Box Timer on iPhone. It also covers how to choose the right
        CrossFit timer app and the mistakes athletes make most often with their
        clocks.

        The five main CrossFit WOD formats
      </h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        1. AMRAP — As Many Rounds As Possible
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AMRAP is the most common format in CrossFit programming.
        <strong>As Many Rounds As Possible</strong> means you set a time cap — typically
        10, 15, or 20 minutes — and perform a fixed movement sequence (e.g., 5 pull-ups,
        10 push-ups, 15 air squats) as many times as you can before the clock runs
        out. Your score is the total number of complete rounds, plus any additional
        reps completed in a partial round.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AMRAP is deliberately open-ended. There is no "finish line" — the goal
        is to manage pacing so you are still moving at full intensity when the
        final second ticks. A common programming choice is to run two athletes
        through the same AMRAP and compare scores.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Scoring example:</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        If the AMRAP is 3 pull-ups + 6 push-ups + 9 squats and you complete 6
        full rounds plus 3 pull-ups and 4 push-ups, your score is "6 + 7" (6
        complete rounds, 7 additional reps).

          <li>Tap <strong>Edit Timer</strong></li>
          <li>Select <strong>Down</strong> (count down from your time cap)</li>
          <li>Set the duration — e.g., 20:00 for a 20-minute AMRAP</li>

        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The descending clock creates urgency. Watching time disappear — rather
        than accumulating — pushes most athletes to keep moving.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        2. EMOM — Every Minute On the Minute
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Every Minute On the Minute</strong> workouts require you to begin
        a set of reps at the start of each minute. Whatever time remains after you
        finish is your rest. The faster you move, the more recovery you earn — which
        makes pacing and efficiency a central skill.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        EMOM workouts are popular for strength-skill development (e.g., 3 power
        cleans every minute for 10 minutes), conditioning (e.g., 10 calories on
        the rower every minute for 12 minutes), and gymnastics practice (e.g., 5
        strict pull-ups every minute for 15 minutes). The total duration is
        usually the number of rounds in minutes — a 10-round EMOM with 1-minute
        intervals lasts exactly 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Variants:</strong> E2MOM (every 2 minutes) and E90S (every 90 seconds)
        follow the same structure with longer intervals, giving athletes more recovery
        time for heavier or more complex movements.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-zinc-100 border border-zinc-200 rounded-lg p-5 mt-4 mb-6">

          <li>Tap <strong>Edit Timer</strong></li>
          <li>Select <strong>Interval</strong></li>
          <li>
            Set <strong>Rounds</strong> to match your desired number of minutes (e.g.,
            10)
          </li>
          <li>
            Set <strong>Work</strong> to 1:00 (or 2:00 for E2MOM, 1:30 for E90S)
          </li>
          <li>Set <strong>Rest</strong> to 0:00</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Start</strong></li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The beep at the start of each round is the signal to begin. Box Timer's
        loud audio cues are audible even under a barbell, so you do not need to
        watch the screen during your set.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">3. For Time</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>For Time</strong> is the simplest CrossFit format: complete a prescribed
        set of work as fast as possible. The clock counts up from zero, and you stop
        it when you finish. Your score is your finishing time. This creates a direct
        sprint incentive — unlike AMRAP, where the endpoint is the clock, For Time
        workouts let athletes push toward a finish line.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Famous benchmark workouts like Fran (21-15-9 thrusters and pull-ups) and
        Helen (3 rounds of 400m run, 21 kettlebell swings, 12 pull-ups) are For
        Time workouts. Most have an implicit or explicit time cap — athletes who
        cannot finish within the cap record their time cap plus reps completed.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Rounds For Time (RFT)</strong> is a variant where a fixed number
        of rounds is prescribed rather than allowing unlimited rounds. "5 Rounds
        For Time" of a given sequence uses the same timer — count up and stop when
        all rounds are done.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-zinc-100 border border-zinc-200 rounded-lg p-5 mt-4 mb-6">
        <p class="font-semibold text-zinc-700 mb-3">
          Timer setup for For Time in Box Timer
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-outside ml-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Tap <strong>Edit Timer</strong></li>
          <li>Select <strong>Up</strong> (count up from zero)</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Start</strong></li>
          <li>Tap the display to pause and record your time when you finish</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">
        If there is a time cap, run the timer as a countdown instead (select
        <strong>Down</strong> and set the cap). Athletes who finish early simply
        stop the timer; athletes who hit the cap note their reps completed.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">4. Tabata</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Tabata is a specific high-intensity interval protocol: <strong
          >8 rounds of 20 seconds work followed by 10 seconds rest</strong
        >, for a total of 4 minutes. It originates from a 1996 study by Dr.
        Izumi Tabata, which found that this protocol produced greater
        improvements in both aerobic and anaerobic capacity than traditional
        steady-state cardio in a fraction of the time.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In CrossFit, Tabata is commonly applied to barbell cycling (thrusters,
        ground-to-overhead), rowing and bike ergometers, and bodyweight
        movements (air squats, push-ups, sit-ups). The 10-second rest interval
        is deliberately insufficient for full recovery, which drives the
        metabolic intensity.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Scoring:</strong> In competition, Tabata scores are recorded as the
        <em>lowest round count</em> across all 8 rounds ("Tabata score"), which penalizes
        athletes who sprint the first rounds and fade. In training, athletes often
        simply count total reps.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-zinc-100 border border-zinc-200 rounded-lg p-5 mt-4 mb-6">
        <p class="font-semibold text-zinc-700 mb-3">
          Timer setup for Tabata in Box Timer
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-outside ml-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Tap <strong>Edit Timer</strong></li>
          <li>Select <strong>Interval</strong></li>
          <li>Set <strong>Rounds</strong> to 8</li>
          <li>Set <strong>Work</strong> to 0:20</li>
          <li>Set <strong>Rest</strong> to 0:10</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Start</strong></li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The beeps at the work/rest transitions are the defining feature of a
        good Tabata timer. At 10 seconds of rest, there is no time to look at
        the screen — the audio cue is what tells you to start again.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        5. Rounds For Time (RFT) and chippers
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Rounds For Time</strong> prescribes a fixed number of rounds completed
        as fast as possible. Unlike AMRAP (unlimited rounds, fixed time), RFT has
        a fixed workload and variable time. "3 Rounds For Time" of 400m run, 21 kettlebell
        swings, 12 pull-ups is a classic example.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        A <strong>chipper</strong> is a long, multi-movement workout done once through
        rather than for rounds — e.g., 50 wall balls, 40 box jumps, 30 pull-ups,
        20 toes-to-bar, 10 clean-and-jerks, For Time. Both use a count-up timer stopped
        when the athlete finishes.

        How to choose a CrossFit timer app
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Most general-purpose timer apps — including the iPhone's built-in clock
        — cannot handle CrossFit workouts. A countdown timer works for AMRAP but
        not EMOM. A stopwatch works for For Time but not Tabata. A dedicated
        CrossFit timer app needs to support all four formats natively.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">Here is what to look for:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>All four WOD formats supported</strong> — AMRAP (countdown), For
          Time (count up), EMOM (interval with no rest), and Tabata (interval with
          work/rest). Apps that only support intervals will not handle AMRAP or For
          Time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loud, distinct audio cues</strong> — You should be able to hear
          the timer from across a gym, over music, and under a loaded barbell. Warning
          beeps in the last few seconds of an interval add significant value during
          Tabata and EMOM work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compatibility with music playback</strong> — Beeps should play
          over your music without pausing or interrupting it. Apps that use video-style
          audio routing kill your playlist at every transition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Large, readable display</strong> — A landscape full-screen mode
          is essential for garage gym athletes who prop their phone up and need to
          read the timer from five meters away.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workout history and saved presets</strong> — Reconfiguring a timer
          from scratch before every workout wastes time and mental energy. The ability
          to save and reload your common WODs is a practical necessity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No ads</strong> — A pop-up ad mid-Tabata is not just annoying.
          It breaks the audio cues and ruins the workout. Paid apps or genuinely
          free apps (no ad-supported tier) are both fine; freemium apps with ads
          in the free tier are not.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-sans font-bold mt-16 mb-4">
        Common timer mistakes CrossFit athletes make
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Running AMRAP as a count-up</strong> — A count-up timer during
          an AMRAP tells you how long you have been working but not how much time
          is left. A countdown from your time cap creates urgency and lets you pace
          rationally. Always use a countdown for AMRAP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Setting rest to nonzero for EMOM</strong> — An EMOM has no explicit
          rest period. The rest is the time between finishing your reps and the next
          minute starting. If you add a separate rest interval in your timer, the
          structure breaks — you will get a rest beep mid-minute rather than beeps
          only at the minute mark.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skipping the countdown lead-in</strong> — Starting a Tabata the
          instant you tap Start means you begin moving before you are positioned.
          A 10-second countdown before the timer starts gives you time to get under
          the bar, grip the handle, or get your hands on the floor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not saving workouts</strong> — If you run the same Friday EMOM
          every week and configure it from scratch each time, you are spending cognitive
          energy that should go into warming up. Save and pin your frequent workouts
          so you can reload them in one tap.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Using a timer that stops music</strong> — Some apps route audio
          through video channels, which pauses any music playing when a beep fires.
          If your CrossFit music cuts out every 20 seconds during Tabata, switch
          to an app that uses system audio mixing to play beeps over the top of music.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trying to use a Tabata-only app for CrossFit</strong> — Several
          popular timer apps support only Tabata and custom intervals. They do not
          support AMRAP (countdown) or For Time (count up). Athletes who invest in
          learning one of these apps often discover the limitation only when they
          try to run a WOD that uses a different format.

        Apps supporting only Tabata and custom intervals cannot run AMRAP or For

        who program across all formats.

        Frequently asked questions
      </h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        What timer is used in CrossFit competitions?
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        CrossFit Games and sanctioned competitions use large wall-mounted
        commercial timers (typically Fringe Sport or similar gym clocks) that
        display time in large LED digits visible from the spectator stands. In
        affiliate box settings, most coaches use a dedicated iPad or TV app, or
        a phone timer propped up near the whiteboard. A smartphone CrossFit
        timer app that replicates the large-digit display and loud beeps is the
        standard for individual athletes training without a dedicated gym clock.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        How long is a typical CrossFit WOD?
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Most CrossFit workouts fall between 8 and 25 minutes of active work,
        excluding warm-up and cool-down. AMRAPs are typically 10–20 minutes.
        EMOMs are usually 10–20 minutes. For Time workouts vary significantly —
        Fran (21-15-9 thrusters and pull-ups) takes elite athletes under 2
        minutes; longer chippers can run 25–35 minutes. Tabata is always exactly
        4 minutes. Total class time at a CrossFit affiliate is usually 60
        minutes, of which the WOD itself represents 10–25 minutes.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        Can I use my iPhone as a CrossFit timer?
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Yes — with the right app. The iPhone's built-in Clock app can run a
        countdown or stopwatch, but it does not support intervals, does not have
        loud round-transition beeps, and does not replicate the EMOM or Tabata
        format without manual restarting. A dedicated CrossFit timer app like
        Box Timer gives you all four WOD formats, automatic transitions, audio
        cues, and a large landscape display — everything the built-in clock
        lacks.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        What is the difference between AMRAP and RFT?
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AMRAP fixes the time and maximizes rounds: the clock determines when you
        stop, and your score is how much work you completed. RFT (Rounds For
        Time) fixes the rounds and minimizes time: the workload is
        predetermined, and your score is how long it took you. AMRAP typically
        uses a countdown timer; RFT uses a count-up timer stopped at completion.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-sans font-bold mt-15 mb-3">
        Is Box Timer free for CrossFit workouts?
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Yes. Box Timer is completely free — no ads, no subscription, no premium
        tier, and no in-app purchases. All WOD formats (AMRAP, EMOM, For Time,
        Tabata, custom intervals), the full workout history, pinned presets, the
        landscape display, and all audio features are available without paying
        anything.
