              WOD stands for "Workout of the day" and is a word often used in
              CrossFit gyms(or boxes as they also are called).

              For most athletes a WOD is a single workout regardless if it's the
              actual workout of the day for the gym. For example Fran, Cindy and
              Murph are popular WODs.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a few different formats and ways to measure score of a
              WOD. These are almost always a combination of time, rounds or
              repitions. That's why a good timer is so useful when doing these
              types of workouts.
