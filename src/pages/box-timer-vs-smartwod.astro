        Box Timer compared to SmartWOD
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-zinc-400 mt-4">Last updated: February 2026</p>
      <p class="py-8">
        Both Box Timer and SmartWOD are great workout timers! You can compare
        both apps down below, but these are some subjective differences to
        consider before choosing.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-8">
        Box Timer have a design that looks like the classic timer at a gym, it's
        easy to see the time and the settings are the same ones that you are
        used to.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-24">
        SmartWOD have a more digital design that makes it more like any other
        app on your phone, this could be good if you're not familiar with the
        timers at gyms.
      </p>

        Who should choose Box Timer?
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Box Timer is the better fit if you want a completely free, no-strings
        timer that never asks you to pay or upgrade. The gym-style digital
        display — large numbers, a subtle glow effect — is designed to mimic the
        wall clock at a CrossFit box, so everything feels familiar from your
        first rep. If your training includes AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, and Tabata
        and you want all four formats in one free app, Box Timer covers them all
        without a paywall.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Box Timer is also the better choice if you train in a garage gym or
        anywhere you need your phone to double as the box clock. The landscape
        mode turns the screen into a large full-screen display you can see from
        across the room, and beeps play over your music without interrupting
        playback.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-sans font-bold mt-16 mb-4">
        Who should choose SmartWOD?
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        SmartWOD is worth considering if Apple Watch integration is a priority.
        Being able to glance at your wrist during a heavy barbell complex — or
        control the timer without touching your phone — is a meaningful
        advantage in a CrossFit setting. SmartWOD also supports eight languages
        compared to Box Timer's six, which matters if you coach athletes
        internationally.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        If you prefer a more conventional app aesthetic over the gym-clock look,
        SmartWOD's interface will feel more at home alongside your other apps.
        The trade-off is cost: the free tier is ad-supported, and removing ads
        requires a paid upgrade.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-sans font-bold mt-16 mb-4">
        Setup comparison: 20-minute AMRAP
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Both apps support AMRAP natively. Here is how you would set up a
        20-minute AMRAP on each:
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Box Timer</strong></p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-outside ml-6 space-y-1 mb-6">
        <li>Tap <strong>Edit Timer</strong></li>
        <li>Select <strong>Down</strong></li>
        <li>Set the time to 20:00</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Start</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>SmartWOD</strong></p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-outside ml-6 space-y-1 mb-6">
        <li>Tap <strong>WOD Timer</strong></li>
        <li>Select <strong>AMRAP</strong></li>
        <li>Set the duration and tap <strong>Start</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Both take roughly the same number of taps. Box Timer keeps the same
        settings until you change them, which is useful if you run the same
        workout multiple days in a row.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-sans font-bold mt-16 mb-4">Pricing</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Box Timer is free with no ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app
        purchases. Every feature is available from day one.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        SmartWOD offers a free tier that includes ads. Removing ads and
        unlocking the full feature set requires a paid upgrade. Check the App
        Store listing for current pricing, as it may change.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-sans font-bold mt-16 mb-4">Verdict</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For most CrossFit athletes and HIIT practitioners, Box Timer is the
        straightforward choice: it is fully free, covers every standard WOD
        format, and looks like the clock you are used to seeing on the gym wall.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Choose SmartWOD if Apple Watch integration is non-negotiable for your
        training. It is a well-built app and the Apple Watch companion adds
        genuine value — just expect to pay for the ad-free experience.
      </p>
