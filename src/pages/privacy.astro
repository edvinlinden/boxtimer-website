        Privacy Policy

        The app
      </h2>
      <p class="pb-8">
        The privacy policy of Box Timer - Workout Timer is very simple – I do
        not collect any personal information about you!
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8">
        I believe that privacy should be protected. The best way to protect it
        is to share as little as possible. In order for me to operate the app
        and for you to use it there's no need to share any personal information.
        It's <i>just</i> a timer after all.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8">
        To identify and fix any issues with the app I use TelemetryDeck to
        collect anonymized usage data. TelemetryDeck <mark
          >does not collect any personally identifiable information</mark
        > and <mark>does not use cookies</mark>. You can read more about

        I may update the Privacy Policy, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by
        posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

        This website
      </h2>
      <p class="pb-8">
        I want to process as little personal information as possible when you
        use my website. That's why I've chosen TelemetryDeck and PostHog for my
        website analytics.

        traffic in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that I can
