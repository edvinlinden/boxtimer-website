        The app
      </h2>
      <p class="pb-8">
        The privacy policy of Box Timer - Workout Timer is very simple – I do
        not collect any personal information about you!
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8">
        I believe that privacy should be protected. The best way to protect it
        is to share as little as possible. In order for me to operate the app
        and for you to use it there's no need to share any personal information.
        It's <i>just</i> a timer after all.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8">
        I may update the Privacy Policy, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by
        posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8">
        If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to
        contact me at help@boxtimer.app
