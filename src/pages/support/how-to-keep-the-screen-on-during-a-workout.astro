        Box Timer automatically keeps your screen on while a timer is running.
        You don't need to change any settings — this happens by default so you
        can always see your timer during a workout.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8">
        When the timer is stopped or reset, normal screen timeout behavior
        resumes to save battery.
